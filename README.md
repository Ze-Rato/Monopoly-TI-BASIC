# Monopoly-TI-BASIC

## General Info
Inspired on the classic board game 'Monopoly'. 
First of all download 'Image9.8ca' and store it on your calculator as Image9 (This is the game board).
To set up a game run *MONOSET*, you can choose from 2 to 4 players! You will then be prompted to enter a name for each player.
After setting up the game run *MONOPLAY* to play the game.

As of now this is more of a proof of concept than anything and to practice algorithms a bit. You can move, buy houses, pay rent and that's about it.
There is not really a schedule for updates I'll update this repo when I feel like it or if I receive interesting suggestions.

## Impotant Note
* The game wasn't tested much, there might be some bugs.
* I'm aware of the excessive "defragmenting" screens.
